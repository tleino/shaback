shaback is a SHA-checksumming backup/restore tool, similar to tar(1),
pax(1), dump(8), but is

   1) free from file size or file name limits
   2) very simple, no legacy cruft
   3) does SHA-checksumming
   4) builds an index and can restore single files fast

Example:

   find / | shaback -w /dev/rsd3c
   shaback -l /dev/rsd3c
   shaback -r /dev/rsd3c /the-file-which-was-lost

Builds an image like this:

   SHABACK_BEGIN <shaback magic number> <time> <shaback end offset>\n
   <type> <ctime> <atime> <mtime> <mode> <uid> <gid> <size> <inode>
   <offset> <fullpath> <hash meta> <hash file>\n
   <shaback magic number> SHABACK_END <time>\n

And then for the files at <offset>

   <shaback magic number> SHABACK <type> <ctime> <atime> <mtime> <mode>
   <uid> <gid> <size> <inode> <offset> <fullpath> <hash meta> <hash file>\n

i.e. metadata is duplicated (in case the index is corrupted).

All entries are aligned to 512-byte blocks in case bad blocks corrupts
something, rest of the blocks can be salvaged cleanly.

The shaback magic number is a random number that is unique so that
corrupted or partially broken backup can be restored.
